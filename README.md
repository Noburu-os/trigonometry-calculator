# trigonometry-calculator

this code takes the numbers you input and computes the answer, it does trigonometry. 
I have an idea, that of wich I cannot pursue because i am not fluent in the coding style "java script"
I am taking classes to further my skills in the coding style
My idea is update this to a point where it breaks down the answer showing exactly how the answer is computed so learners can visualize trigonometry better.
This would also be great to help cheaters in their homework...but don't cheat, because if you do you wont learn and you'll be homeless.


So i need a team of people who are fluent in "java script" to help me, make a pull request and i'll probably accept.

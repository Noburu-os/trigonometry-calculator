# trigonometry-calculator

this is a python program I would love for people to edit to advance this calculator, if you know python 3 this is for you.
Some ideas  have in mind are a system that breaks it down and shows you step by step how the answer is made, i would prefer that this idea is built in the coding style "java script"
so users can visualze the work better so if you use this to cheat on math homework and have to write how you got the answer you just copy it down
but don't cheat, you wont learn.
